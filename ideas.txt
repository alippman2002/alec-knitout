WEEK 0: 

Initial brainstorm:
1. Write fragmented appraoch for developing knits 
2. Begin with identifying needles that will be used
3. Write cast-on functions
4. Is there a library of knit techniques or more just file based?
5. Think of ways to add in patterns and use numbers and modulo to work
6. To-Do:
        - Review Github
        - Decide ways to code effectively 
        - Break down shaping methods to operations
        - Think of ways to use numbers and management effectively

WEEK 1:

Ways to try making pleat/folds along curves
- knit on front bed until cetain distance to fold, then back bed and float 
tuck at the valley/river of the fold
- Use yarns that hold memory well

Technical notes:
- Begin knitting from RIGHT to LEFT! (same as knitting tutorial cast ons)

- 0, 1, 2, 3, ... width (needle positions)

- RIGHT TO LEFT is negative direction
- LEFT TO RIGHT is positive direction 

- 0 is FALSE
- 1 is TRUE when using %

- modulo will be powerful for creating knit patterns 

Questions:

- Max width and height for shima swatches?
- why does the rib rectangle code cast on like two passes of tucks
- Confused a bit about 
    for i in range(width-1, 0, -2):
    for i in range(0, width, 2):
    Since start at width - 1 first pass stop before 0
    Start at 0 stop before width, so do we not cast onto width? does it 
    
    This casts onto every needle on one bed then every needle on other bed since always -2


- why use python as a lot of the knitout stuff is referencing javascript
- Half/Full pitch? how is this set
- Range is starting inclusive, stopping exclusive!

- need to figure out knit module error 

- Is it good practice to knit with even amount of needles using modulo for cast on
        - knowing that 0, width - 1 are what actually is going to be knit on?


- Use modulo for transferring to specific ribbing dimensions (fragmenting knit operations over a range over a domain)
- set specific remainders to f and others to b or to specific operations 

- is there a way to check what is currently on the bed where
        - thinking about transferring and unsure if bad to transfer if it is already on the bed
        - transferring f10 to f10? or can i check what is on a needle?

        - Theoretically, if i have yarn on f10 and write xfer(+ or -, b10, f10) what happens


- weft / warp knitting? explain a bit more / folding implications (we use warp in shima!(?))
- what functions or additionalresources should i look at?

Things I should try next:

- Writing a pleat function that allows you to specify:
        r -> amount of 1x1 rib for one flat part of fold
        b -> amount of needles knit on BACK bed (VALLEY)
        r2 -> amount of 1x1 rib for second flat part of fold
        f -> amount of needles knit on FRONT bed (MOUNTAIN)

        - split it up using modulo of (r+b+r2+f)
        - allow to rapidly program 


conda install -n knitout-env knitout

A module is essentially a python file
A package is the directory containing modules

For knitout.py module, I must import knitout
