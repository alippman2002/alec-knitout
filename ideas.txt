WEEK 0: 

Initial brainstorm:
1. Write fragmented appraoch for developing knits 
2. Begin with identifying needles that will be used
3. Write cast-on functions
4. Is there a library of knit techniques or more just file based?
5. Think of ways to add in patterns and use numbers and modulo to work
6. To-Do:
        - Review Github
        - Decide ways to code effectively 
        - Break down shaping methods to operations
        - Think of ways to use numbers and management effectively

WEEK 1:

Ways to try making pleat/folds along curves
- knit on front bed until cetain distance to fold, then back bed and float 
tuck at the valley/river of the fold
- Use yarns that hold memory well

Technical notes:
- Begin knitting from RIGHT to LEFT! (same as knitting tutorial cast ons)
- 0, 1, 2, 3, ... width (needle positions)
- RIGHT TO LEFT is negative direction
- LEFT TO RIGHT is positive direction 

- 0 is FALSE
- 1 is TRUE when using %
- modulo will be powerful for creating knit patterns 

- Range is starting inclusive, stopping exclusive!

3d knit cast on technique for ribbing
    for i in range(width-1, 0, -2):
    for i in range(0, width, 2):
    Since start at width - 1 first pass stop before 0
    Start at 0 stop before width, so do we not cast onto width? does it 
    
    This casts onto every needle on one bed then every needle on other bed since always -2

Knit with even amount of needles using modulo for cast on
        - knowing that 0, width - 1 are what actually is going to be knit on!

- Use modulo for transferring to specific ribbing dimensions (fragmenting knit operations over a range over a domain)
- set specific remainders to f and others to b or to specific operations 

conda install -n knitout-env knitout

For knitout.py module, I must import knitout
add to system path! check code to  add module to system path

A module is a python file
A package is the directory containing modules

Questions:

- Max width and height for shima swatches?
width of shima - 360 wide

- why does the rib rectangle code cast on two passes of tucks (one on F other pass on B)
        - talked about this, try thsi method on flat-bed, but also just try different cast-on methods 
        - general cast-on method for all?

-How is half/full pitch set
RACK BY 0.5

- is there a way to check what is currently on the bed?
        - use a data structure 


# What is this for?
k.releasehook(carrier)

- What issues do you see in my 3x5 rib and variable rib, and how should I expand upon these ideas for next Thursday?

WEEK 2:
- Expand upon variablerib to create a diagonal shift 
                - use j to shift where i is classified for what knit pattern!
                - create a var that can be incremeted but maybe based on modulo too (wider patterns by holding pattern for few stitches)

Week 3: 

TO-DOs: 
- PLAN ALL OF THIS BY NEXT THURSDAY:

- Fix issues in all 3 Python files so far, primarily with transfers from tucks and range excluding final stitch 
- Ensure transfers are happening properly in diagonal code
- Incorporate rack(0.5) for half pitch
- Create standardization on 1x1 ribbing so that beginning and end of rib are on opposite sides of mountain/valley knit on F/B bed
- Draw a lot of knit diagrams to show diagonal pattern trasnfer and figure out how to xfer accordingly to shift knit things for pattern correctly
- CREATE TIMELINE for literature review 



Notes:
        - easier to debug just one iteration of the pattern
