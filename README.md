# alec-knitout
Alec's knitout files for Bertoldi Group

Simple knit swatches are found in initial_dev folder.

Pixel-based development for the square waterbomb tessellation fold are in the pixel folder. Pixel inputs used to debug and to create varying origami knits are found in pixel/pixel_ref. The .k files geneerated for each tessellation knit can also be referenced.

To use pixel.py, create a pixel input using white, red, and black:

# White -> Mountain Fold
# Black -> Flat Section
# Red -> Valley Fold

Add your pixel file's name into pixel.py and a .k file will be written when the program is run.
